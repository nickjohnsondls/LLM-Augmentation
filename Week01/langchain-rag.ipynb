This is called the ‘warmchampagne’ effect. Rising temperature will also stimulate aerobic bacteria. Their respiration willrelease carbon dioxide. This is called the ‘warm beer’ effect (CALDER, 1999).\n",

The most important of all, however, is watervapour. This enters into the calculations only indirectly, because its concentration varies greatlyfrom place to place and from day to day and because it is strongly affected by temperature. Itsinfluence, therefore, tends to add to those of the other gases and generally varies as they do. Figure2.13 shows the anticipated changes in concentration for carbon dioxide, methane, and CFC-12,which is one of the family of CFC compounds. These increases are based on the (uncertain) assumptionthat industrial and vehicle emissions are the only source of carbon dioxide.\n",

The idea is now gaining ground that present changes in theatmosphere and climate are more likely to be due to changes in solar output and volcanic eruptionsthan to human intervention (CALDER, 1999).\n",

At one time it was thought that ice ages begin and end gradually, it taking centuriesor longer for the ice sheets to spread. This may be incorrect. According to the ‘snowblitz’ theory,a slight fall in summer temperatures in high latitudes might allow some of the winter snow tosurvive where in previous years it had melted. The affected areas would then be white, whenpreviously they had been dark, thus increasing albedo and lowering temperature further. Insucceeding years, the snow-covered area would increase and temperatures would continue to fall,climatic forcing by the increased albedo accelerating the change by a strongly positive feedback.It might take very little time to move from our present interglacial climates to a full glaciation.Warming can also proceed rapidly, the change from glacial to interglacial perhaps taking no morethan a few decades.\n",

This politicizationand resultant popular dramatization of a very complex and uncertain issue has attracted criticism(BOEHMER-CHRISTIANSEN, 1994; BOLIN, 1995).\n",

Measurements of greenhouse-gas concentrations must also distinguish between genuine changes, the ‘signal’, and natural variations,the ‘noise’. Carbon dioxide levels vary seasonally, for example, in response to the growing seasonfor plants.\n",

The correlation isconvincing, although it is possible that the fluctuating greenhouse-gas concentration is an effect oftemperature change rather than the cause of it. As temperatures rose at the end of the last ice age, theincrease in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide lagged behind the temperature (CALDER,1999) and so carbon dioxide cannot have been the cause of the warming. There is also evidence thatthe carbon dioxide concentration was far from constant prior to the start of the Industrial Revolution(WAGNER ET AL. , 1999).
